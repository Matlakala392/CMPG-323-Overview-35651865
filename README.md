## Branching Strategy to be Used in Each Project:

For each project, I will be working from the project's master branch, which represents the stable version of my code. This branch typically contains the code that is released or published. To maintain its stability, I will avoid adding new features directly to this branch.
To develop new features, I will create an isolated environment called the develop branch. This branch will serve as the working version of my code before it is merged into the master branch. From the develop branch, I will also create feature branches for specific tasks, such as the Tech Trends Solutions.
The workflow will be as follows:
1.	Create a feature branch from the develop branch.
2.	Work on the new feature in the feature branch.
3.	Once the feature is complete and tested, merge the feature branch back into the develop branch.
4.	After ensuring that the develop branch is stable and tested, merge it into the master branch.

This strategy ensures that new features are thoroughly tested in an isolated environment before being integrated into the stable version of the code. This branching strategy aligns with common practices in version control and software development.
